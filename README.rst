# Compliance Flask

## Overview

**Compliance Tools** is a [Flask app](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/) that facilitate the creation of system specific compliance documentation. For example, these tools may be used to generate a System Security Plan (SSP) which is a necessary component of an Authority to Operate (ATO) for federal systems.

### To Do

Pretty much everything.
